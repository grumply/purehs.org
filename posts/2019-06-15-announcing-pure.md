# Announcing Pure

I'm pleased to announce the first public release of Pure, a library ecosystem 
for web applications, servers, and services.

In the process of developing Pure, I implemented a number of libraries to poke
and prod at the boundaries implied by various abstractions. Over time, to 
improve the expressiveness and concision, I rewrote and refined the abstractions
and incorporated ideas from many web frameworks, including ReactJS, Elm, and
Servant.

Pure uses a best-in-class rendering and reconciliation algorithm and can match
or exceed the performance of top-tier web frameworks like React, Vue, and 
Angular.

If you're interested, take a look at the tutorials. If you're really interested,
feel free to improve the tutorials to benefit others.
