# Announcing Pure

I'm pleased to announce the first public release of Pure, a library ecosystem for web applications, servers, and services.

In the process of developing Pure, I implemented a number of libraries to poke and prod at the boundaries implied by various core abstractions. Over time, to improve the expressiveness and concision, I rewrote and refined Pure many times and incorporated ideas from many web frameworks, including ReactJS, Elm, and Servant.

Pure is still an active testbed for Haskell web framework ideas, but has mostly settled in the last year.

Pure uses a best-in-class rendering and reconciliation algorithm and can match or exceed the performance of top-tier web frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
