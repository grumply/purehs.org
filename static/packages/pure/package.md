`Pure` is a meta-library that re-exports the core Pure.hs ecosystem.

Exported modules include those from

  * [pure-core](/packages/pure-core/latest)
  * [pure-default](/packages/pure-default/latest)
  * [pure-dom](/packages/pure-dom/latest)
  * [pure-events](/packages/pure-events/latest)
  * [pure-html](/packages/pure-html/latest)
  * [pure-lifted](/packages/pure-lifted/latest)
  * [pure-state](/packages/pure-state/latest)
  * [pure-styles](/packages/pure-styles/latest)
  * [pure-theme](/packages/pure-theme/latest)
  * [pure-time](/packages/pure-time/latest)
  * [pure-txt](/packages/pure-txt/latest)

When developing a Pure application, most modules that use Pure functionality will import the `Pure` module. An alternative that re-exports much of this meta-library is [pure-elm](/packges/pure-elm/latest).
