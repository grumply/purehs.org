This is an internal package and not the best place to learn how to develop with Pure.hs. Consider starting with the [5-Minute Series](/tutorials/5-minute).

This package implements core functionality for view injection and reconciliation, exporting a single function, [inject](/packages/pure-dom/latest/Pure.DOM/inject).

You probably don't need to include this package as a dependency of your project, as it is exported from the meta packages [pure](/packages/pure/latest) and [pure-elm](/packages/pure-elm/latest).
