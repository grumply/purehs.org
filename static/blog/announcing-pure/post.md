I am pleased to announce the first public release of Pure.hs, a library ecosystem for web applications, servers, and services. In the process of developing Pure.hs, I implemented dozens of libraries - some useful, some not - to poke and prod at the boundaries and capabilities implied by various core abstractions. Over time, to improve the expressiveness, performance, and concision, I rewrote and refined Pure.hs many times and incorporated ideas from many web frameworks, including ReactJS, Elm, and Servant. Starting, originally, from imperative origins, Pure.hs evolved into a reactive framework, before finally finding its footing in a reactive/declarative hybrid that focuses on hierachies of dependent contexts. The version seen today is vastly different from the original, and hopefully something you'll enjoy using.

Pure.hs is still an active testbed for Haskell web framework ideas, but has mostly settled in the last year. Pure.hs uses a well-optimized rendering and reconciliation algorithm and can match or exceed the performance of top-tier web frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.
