# APIs

A generic abstraction over APIs allows for well-typed and composable 
client-to-server, server-to-server, and server-to-client communication.

As a demonstration, the API for this site:

```haskell
mkRequest "GetPost"     [t|Slug -> Maybe Post|]
mkRequest "GetTutorial" [t|Slug -> Maybe Tutorial|]
mkRequest "GetDoc"      [t|(Pkg,Ver) -> Maybe Doc|]
mkRequest "GetPage"     [t|Slug -> Maybe Page|]

server = api msgs reqs
  where
    msgs = none
    reqs = getPost <:> getTutorial <:> getDoc <:> getPage <:> none

mkMessage "SetCache" [t|Cache|]

client = api msgs reqs
  where
    msgs = setCache <:> none
    reqs = none
```

> Note that `mkRequest` is unary and `mkMessage` is constant.
