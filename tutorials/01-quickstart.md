## What is Pure? -- WIP

Pure is a [Haskell](https://haskell.org) framework that admits a unified development architecture for interactive systems. Pure can be compiled to JavaScript with [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) to build web, desktop, and mobile applications, or natively compiled with [GHC](https://haskell.org/ghc) to build web servers and networked services.

Pure takes the hierarchical structure and contextualization that is ubiquitous in modern `html` user interfaces, and extends the concept to backend development.
